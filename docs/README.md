# maerOS

maerOS is simple multi-tasking kernel developed by following an [online course](https://www.udemy.com/course/developing-a-multithreaded-kernel-from-scratch/). 

This work and **source codes are derived from** [Github Page](https://github.com/nibblebits/PeachOS/tree/master)

maerOS is based on Intel x86 Architecture and implemented on QEMU virtual emulator. This work contains followings:
- Creating a multi-tasking kernel from scratch
- Real Mode and Protected Mode Development
- Understanding how memory works in computers
- Differentiating between kernel and user space
- Understanding and implementing virtual memory
- Developing processes and tasks in the kernel
- FAT16 filesystem implementation
- Writing simple drivers, i.e. keyboard driver, disk driver
- Loading ELF files
- Debugging disassembled machine code
- Debugging your kernel in an emulator with GDB
